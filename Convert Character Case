//
// The purpose of this program is to convert a character from uppercase to
// lowercase.  Answers to specific questions are as follows:
// 1. If the user enters anything other than an uppercase character, they will
//    obtain a character that may be a letter, number, or non-alphanumeric
//    character.  This is because the program relies on simple arithmetic and
//    the difference between a lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent
//    in the ASCII character code table (which is 32) to do the conversion.
// 2. If the user precedes the input character with a whitespace, they will
//    actually be entering two characters into the cin.get prompt and the
//    cin.get command is only intended to input a single character.  Thus, the
//    user-intended input character will be ignored.
//

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //
    // This program calculates the difference between decimal equivalents of the
    // entries for 'a' and 'A' in the ASCII table, which is 32.  Then, the
    // program asks user to enter a desired uppercase letter, converts it to 
    // int, adds the result to the case difference constant, and converts the
    // result back to char.  The converted result is thus the lowercase
    // equivalent of what the user entered.
    //
    const int CASE_DIFF = 'a' - 'A';
    cout << "Enter a letter: ";
    char upper = char(cin.get());
    char lower = char(int(upper) + CASE_DIFF);
    cout << "The lowercase equivalent of '" << upper << "' is '" << lower 
        << "'\n";

    return 0;
}
